# Sweet Shop Management System 

This project is a full-stack **Sweet Shop Management System**.  
It features a RESTful API backend with **FastAPI** and a single-page frontend application built using **React**.  

### Admin Credentials
- **Email:** magan@example.com  
- **Password:** string  

> **Note:** Login is required to access and use the application.

To view the application as a general user, simply **register as a new user** and enjoy exploring the sweets catalog and shopping features.

### Live Deployment

## Project Details

The backend is built with **FastAPI**, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.  
The frontend is a modern single-page application (SPA) built using **React**.  

The application manages a list of sweets, allowing users to view, search, purchase, and (for administrators) manage inventory.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **RESTful Backend API:** Built with FastAPI, handling all data logic.  
- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in, with secure token-based authentication (JWT) for protected endpoints.  
- **Sweets Management:** API endpoints for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting sweets.  
- **Inventory Management:** Functionality to purchase sweets (decreasing quantity) and restock them (increasing quantity).  
- **Modern Frontend:** An interactive React SPA for a great user experience.  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** The project was developed with a focus on writing tests before implementation to ensure high test coverage and a robust application.

## My AI Usage ü§ñ

This project was built with assistance from AI tools, which are an integral part of my modern development workflow.

### AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**

### How I Used Them
- **Backend Development:** Used ChatGPT to generate some unit tests and initial boilerplate code for API endpoints, allowing me to focus more on core business logic and validation rules.  
- **Frontend Development:** Used ChatGPT to create the frontend application using React, React Router v7, and shadcn UI. This included generating component structures and initial layouts.  

### Reflection
AI significantly accelerated my development process by automating repetitive and boilerplate tasks. However, I ensured that the code was not simply copied, but used as a starting point that I augmented with my own logic, validation, and design choices to maintain a unique, high-quality result.

## Test Report üß™

A comprehensive test suite was run to ensure the quality and functionality of the backend API.
